        the time to make the pizza base when the dough is ready. Dust the space
        a little using dry flour and take a large amount of the pizza dough.
        Using a rolling pin, roll this dough into a nice circular base. (Note:
        Make sure that the circular base is even at all ends.) Once you have
        made the base, use a fork and prick the base with it so that the base
        doesn't rise and gets baked nicely. Put it into the preheated oven and
        bake it 10 minutes. Now, your pizza base is ready.

        mozzarella cheese in separate bowls.

        and apply tomato ketchup all over. Spread half the processed cheese all
        over the base and evenly put the veggies all across the base. Once you
        have put all the veggies, put a thick layer of mozzarella cheese.

        in a baking tray and place it inside the oven. Let the pizza bake 10
        minutes at 250 degree Celsius. Once done, take out the baking tray and
        slice the pizza. Sprinkle oregano and chilli flakes as per your taste
